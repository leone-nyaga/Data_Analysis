# PANDAS

Pandas is a data manipulation package in Python for tabular data. That is, data in the form of rows and columns, also known as DataFrames. Intuitively, you can think of a DataFrame as an Excel sheet. 

Pandasâ€™ functionality includes data transformations, like sorting rows and taking subsets, to calculating summary statistics such as the mean, reshaping DataFrames, and joining DataFrames together. pandas works well with other popular Python data science packages, often called the PyData ecosystem, including

+ NumPy for numerical computing
+ Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and other data visualization packages
+ scikit-learn for machine learning
