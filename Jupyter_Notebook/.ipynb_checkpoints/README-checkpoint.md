Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly powerful tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects. It combines code, visualizations, narrative text, and other rich media into a single document, creating a cohesive and expressive workflow.

## What is Jupyter Notebook?

At its core, a notebook is a document that blends code and its output seamlessly. It allows you to run code, display the results, and add explanations, formulas, and charts all in one place. This makes your work more transparent, understandable, and reproducible.

Jupyter Notebooks have become an essential part of the data science workflow in companies and organizations worldwide. They enable data scientists to explore data, test hypotheses, and share insights efficiently.

As an [open-source project](https://jupyter.org), Jupyter Notebooks are completely free. You can download the software directly from the [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install) or as part of the [Anaconda data science toolkit](https://jupyter.org/install).

Jupyter Notebooks support multiple programming languages like R, Julia, and Scala are also supported. But it's commonly used with Python.
